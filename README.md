 # :bookmark_tabs: What you will learn
 
 * Understand what data analytics is and why it is important
 * Experiment with data analytics using basic and advanced queries
 * Interpret data through descriptive statistics and aggregate functions
 * Work with and manipulate data using SQL joins and constraints
 * Speed up your data analysis workflow by optimizing queries
 
 # :bookmark: What are window functions ?
 
 * Nothing to do with Windows OS
 * Standard functionality added to T-SQL
 * Functions that operate on a set or window of rows
 * Always with an OVER clause (but sometimes you will see an OVER clause without a window funtion)
 * Always found in the SELECT and ORDER BY
